# Before and After

NOTE: videos will be automatically muted to allow for autoPlay.

## Usage in Core

```
#beforeandafter
[before media]
[after media]
#endbeforeandafter
```

### Options

- `#beforeandafterSTART80` - start the slider at 80%
- `#beforeandafterMODEpeek` - do a peek instead of a slide (other values are fade, ...)

## TODO

- `util.js` - Image embeds on mobile have a smaller resolution that what is probably required.
